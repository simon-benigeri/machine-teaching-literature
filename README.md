# machine-teaching-literature

This repo organizes my notes on machine teaching related papers.

## [Introduction](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/machine-teaching-literature/tree/main/introduction)

You will find an overview of the field, including:
- useful definitions
- links and summaries of some key papers

## [Existing Systems](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/machine-teaching-literature/tree/main/existing%20systems)

You will find links, papers, paper summaries, and descriptions for some existing machine teaching sytems. 

*Note on Snorkel*: Snorkel is not a machine teaching system, but we can use some of the functionalities provided by the libraries in the Snorkel "universe" to build a machine teaching prototype.

## [Datasets](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/machine-teaching-literature/tree/main/datasets)

This resource was originally to come up with use cases for a system built with Snorkel AI. You will find a description of the process for training a text classifier for antisemtic tweets using Snorkel. You will also find some links to datasets that can be used for various text processing tasks, like classification and NER. Those datasets are probably not very useful because we pivoted to court docket entries. However, I recommend you pay attention to the process used to train the tweet classifier. It provides a simple procedure to follow to collect and label data, to define and evaluate labeling functions, and to train the label model and text classifier.

## [Need to read](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/machine-teaching-literature/tree/main/need%20to%20read)

A folder with papers that seem worth reading but that I have not really looked at.
