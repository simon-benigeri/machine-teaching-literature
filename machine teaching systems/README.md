This directory is divided into 2 parts.

### 1. [Existing Systems](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/machine-teaching-literature/tree/main/machine%20teaching%20systems/existing%20systems)

You will find links, papers, paper summaries, and descriptions for some existing machine teaching sytems. 

### 2. [Data Programming](https://github.com/simon-benigeri/machine-teaching-literature/tree/main/machine%20teaching%20systems/data%20programming)

This section introduces Snorkel, data programming, weak supervision, extensions to Snorkel, and alternatives to Snorkel.

Data programming is not machine teaching. However, data programming can create large training sets, quickly. Some of the functionalities provided by data programming libraries support knowledge decomposition. Libraries like Snorkel provide data programming and weak supervision functionalities that we can use to build a machine teaching prototype.
