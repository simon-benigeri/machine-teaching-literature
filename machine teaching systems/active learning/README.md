# Active Learning
The following section introduces Active Learning. The goal of this section is to provide some examples of how Active Learning is used to create machine teaching systems.

Deep learning poses several difficulties for active learning
1. In active learning we handle small amounts of data, but recent (in 2016) advances in deep learning require large amounts of data.
2. Many acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty. In deep learning we rarely represent such model uncertainty. 

This paper relies on Bayesian approaches to deep learning and uses them in the active learning framework in a practical way.
