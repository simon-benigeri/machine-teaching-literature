## Existing Systems
Some notes about existing machine teaching systems. We can inspire ourselves from these or integrate them 

### Microsoft [Project Bonsai](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/product/)

### [Snorkel.org](https://www.snorkel.org/)

#### Key functionality: Programmatically labeling data
1. Users can programmatically label data using labeling function-rules, heuristics, and other custom complex operators
2. Not sure about the interface
3. Lots of Jupyter notebook examples

### Snorkel Flow by [Snorkel.ai](https://snorkel.ai/platform/#how-it-works)

#### Key functionality: Programmatically labeling data + UI
1. Users can programmatically label data using labeling function-rules, heuristics, and other custom complex operators
2. Interface to create labeling functions is a push-button UI or Python SDK with integrated notebooks
3. System provides ready-made labeling functions (LF) builders, data exploration tools,  and auto-suggest features 
4. Users receive instant feedback with coverage and accuracy estimates of LFs to develop so as to build a high-quality training data set
5. Lots of research that suggests ideas for building a similar system

### Explosion.ai [Prodigy](https://explosion.ai/blog/prodigy-annotation-tool-active-learning)
#### Key functionality: Annotation tool for active learning
1. Interface to label samples
2. System uses uncertainty sampling to surface examples for user to label

### Random stuff
#### Some repo that used MT for image classification
