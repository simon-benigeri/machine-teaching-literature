## Existing Systems
Some notes about existing machine teaching systems. We can inspire ourselves from these or integrate them 

### Microsoft [Project Bonsai](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/product/)

### [Snorkel.ai](https://snorkel.ai/platform/#how-it-works)

#### Key functionality: Labeling Functions
1. Users can programmatically label data using labeling function-rules, heuristics, and other custom complex operators
2. Interface to create labeling functions is a push-button UI or Python SDK with integrated notebooks
3. System provides ready-made labeling functions (LF) builders, data exploration tools,  and auto-suggest features 
4. Users receive instant feedback with coverage and accuracy estimates of LFs to develop so as to build a high-quality training data set

#### Some repo that used MT for image classification
